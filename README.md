# [Larazona](http://larazona.org/) Ticket Resale Site Project

In order to get hands on learning we will be building an actual project using Laravel and related tools. The project we have decided to build is a ticket resale website similar to sites like StubHub and SeatGeek that many people have probably already used.

We will utilize an API provided by Ticket Evolution, which is a company that aggregates inventory from hundreds of brokers throughout the US and the rest of the world.

Everyone is invited to work on their own project, but if you miss a meeting, fall behind, or just prefer what someone else has already started feel free to fork someone else’s project and continue working.

Each developer should use their own public repository. Please edit the [Repositories](https://github.com/larazona/ticket-resale-site/blob/master/readme.md#Repositories) section below to add a link to yours and send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/larazona/ticket-resale-site/pulls) to have your repository added to the list.

Each month we’ll ask that each participant presents a quick overview of their progress to the group so that we can discuss the decisions made and learn from each other’s code.
